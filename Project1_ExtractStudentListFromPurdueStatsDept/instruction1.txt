Could you write python code to extract all students from this website: https://www.stat.purdue.edu/people/graduate_students/index.html?  I would you to extract all 
  the following information: 
	1) Student Name
	2) Program (MS or PhD),  
        3) Office location 
        4) Email.  
If some information is missing, then leave if blank.  I would like the output to a csv file with file name: students.csv
